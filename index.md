### CPSC 120
Lab 5

    Lab 5 allowed me to understand the fundementals of basic multiplication inside of a source file
    as well as how to get started with basic ranges by using greater-than,less-than, or equal-to signs.
    Although after going through all of these labs, it seems as though this should be easy for someone
    like me, initially it was a tough task initially because I was new to the whole coding scene.

Lab 9

    Although this lab was one of the toughest ones that I had encountered, It was one of the most
    fulfilling ones once I had finished the code. This Lab had me take texts from different files
    and compare them to a dictionary in order to see what is a mispelled word. This was tough for me
    just because of the fact that I had spelled a singular word wrong. Furthermore, in part 2, creating
    a simple game where you answer the numbers was super simple for me because it was just creating
    ranges in order to check if the inputted number was correct or not

Lab 11

    The most recent lab was Lab 11. This lab was interesting especially due to the creative freedom
    that my partner and I had gotten when creating the code. Although I am sure that the code in the
    long run all looks the same for everyone else, alot of our filler variables were named silly
    names or words. This lab was big on classes, using both private and public variables in order to
    record an answer from the user. Furthermore, part-2 was way easier than part-1, having you make
    a game by guessing a random number that is given by an RNG machine.
